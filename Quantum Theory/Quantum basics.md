Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This quality enables quantum computers to perform many calculations at once. 

In Quantum Mechanics, the states form a complex vector space. What this means is that *if I have one state, then all multiples of that state are also possible*. It also means if *I have two or more states then all linear combinations of those states are possible*. 
## Qubit gates

### Not gate (X)
Takes a qubit and sends 0 to 1 and vceversa.
