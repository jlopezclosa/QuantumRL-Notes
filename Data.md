# Benchmark quantum circuits

## QFT

Quantum Fourier Transform without final qubit reordering swaps.
## Quantum Volume

## Graph state

Refers to the encoder circuit for a graph having as many nodes as qubits in the circuit (namely 50 or 100) and a random adjacency matrix with 0.5 density. 
## Draper Adder

## Cuccaro Adder

##  QNN

## Deutsch-Jozsa

One of the first proposed algorithms with exponential speed up with respect to a classical algorithm, based on a black box function which takes as input a binary string and outputs a bit, it determines whether the function is constant or balanced (the output is 0 for half of the inputs and 1 for the other half)
